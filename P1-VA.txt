A vulnerability analysis is a review that focuses on security-relevant issues that either moderately or severely impact the security of the product or system.
The security scanning process consists of four steps: testing, analysis, assessment and remediation.
1. Vulnerability identification (testing)
  The objective of this step is to draft a comprehensive list of an application’s vulnerabilities.It can be tested by     scanning them with automated tools, or testing and evaluating them manually.
2. Vulnerability analysis
 The objective of this step is to identify the source and root cause of the vulnerabilities. For example, the root cause of a vulnerability could be an old version of an open source library. This provides a clear path for remediation.
3. Risk assessment
  The objective of this step is the prioritizing of vulnerabilities. t involves security analysts assigning a rank or severity score to each vulnerability, based on such factors as: What data is at risk, Severity of an attack.
4. Remediation
 The objective of this step is the closing of security gaps. Specific remediation steps might include:
Introduction of new security procedures, measures or tools.
The updating of operational or configuration changes.
